     * REPAIR THE RELATIVE ASSET PATHS ON ANY PAGE BELOW THE ROOT.

     * `base: './'` makes Vite emit document-relative URLs — './assets/app.js',
     * './fonts/…', './favicon.svg'. That is correct for dist/index.html and
     * wrong for dist/hr/index.html, where './assets/app.js' resolves to
     * /hr/assets/app.js and 404s. vite-react-ssg writes the same template to
     * both depths and does not rewrite them.
     *
     * So: for every page one or more directories down, walk the prefix back
     * up. This runs after the preload links are injected, so it catches the
     * whole head. Only href/src attribute values that literally start './'
     * are touched — inline SVG path data ('d="M32 76…"') and the absolute
     * URLs in the JSON-LD are left alone.
     *
     * The mirror of this for assets OUR code references out of public/ is
     * assetPrefix() in src/i18n/locales.js. See CLAUDE.md → Deployment.
