/**
 * URLs for the files in public/.
 *
 * `base` is './' (see vite.config.js) so one build serves both from the
 * GitHub project-pages sub-path and from the custom-domain root. Everything
 * Vite emits is document-relative to match — './assets/app.js', './fonts/…'
 * in index.html, '../fonts/…' from the CSS — and files in public/ have to be
 * referenced the same way, because Vite does not rewrite them.
 *
 * A hard-coded '/images/…' ignores all of that and 404s under the sub-path.
 * Route every public asset through here.
 *
 * Note this cannot use import.meta.env.BASE_URL: for a relative base Vite
 * resolves that to '/', which is the bug it looks like the fix for.
 *
 * THE PREFIX ARGUMENT. Since the site became bilingual there are two page
 * depths, not one: / and /hr/. A document-relative './images/x' is correct
 * from the root and resolves to the non-existent /hr/images/x from the
 * Croatian page, so the prefix has to come from the locale. Do not call these
 * two functions directly — use the bound copies off `useLang()`, which supply
 * it:
 *
 *     const { responsivePhoto } = useLang()
 *     const shot = responsivePhoto('portrait', [400, 700, 1100])
 *
 * The default keeps a bare call working at the root, which is what the
 * favicon and font links in index.html rely on.
